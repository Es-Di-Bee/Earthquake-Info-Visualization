# Earthquake-Info-Visualization

This is an Interactive Java program which displays information about earthquakes all over the world on a world map. One can interact with the program as one's needs to focus on a particular earthquake or a particular city. If focused on an earthquake, this program will then show details about that particular earthquake like its' magnitude, depth, origin etc and will also show the impact area of that earthquake. Again, earthquakes are also labelled as ocean and land earthquakes. The earthquake marker on the world map varies in size and color depending on the magnitude and depth of the earthquake. Moreover, if the user interacts with the program and focuses on a particular city, this program will then show details about that city and will also show if any earthquake has affected that city. 
This program was developed using Unfolding Library and Processing language. Also fully implemented the concepts of Inheritance.
